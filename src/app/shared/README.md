# Shared Module

This folder contains reusable components, directives, pipes, and utilities that are used across multiple features.

## Structure

- **components/** - Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
- **directives/** - Custom Angular directives
- **pipes/** - Custom Angular pipes for data transformation
- **utils/** - Utility functions and helper classes

## Guidelines

- Components here should be truly reusable across features
- Keep feature-specific components in their respective feature folders
- Use standalone components (Angular 14+)
